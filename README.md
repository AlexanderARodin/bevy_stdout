# bevy_stdout - StdoutPlugin
- the main goal is learning [bevyengine](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) and maybe even more
- core idea was inspired by [bevy_crossterm](https://github.com/ecrax/bevy_crossterm)
- also using [crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm) under hood
- there is big lack of functionallity but simplicity for changings

  
# how does it work
- // TODO
